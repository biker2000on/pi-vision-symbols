# PI Vision Extensions written for Ingevity Corporation

All of these extensions are written for Ingevity, but are released for public use as is. 

## Left remaining on SlickGrid

* editor dependent on tag type (Not required, currently just defaults to Float Editor. Could add editor selection to config.)
* excel copy/paste functionality (This will require different keyboard shortcuts for copy and paste as the others are taken by PI Vision)
* edit datetime and update all points
* DONE Input of "" deletes value from PI
* DONE Datetime editor (HTML5's datetime-local input is not very good, so left it as a text editor.)
* DONE Updates grid once PI has received the new values. Receipt time is highly variable. 
* DONE change naming from config
* DONE edit functionality
* DONE update colors when config changes
* DONE update headers when config changes
* DONE column width in config
* DONE Datetime column custom sorter algorithm

## Durational Curves / ECDF 

* DONE multiple tags at once
