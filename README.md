# PI Vision Extensions written for Ingevity Corporation

All of these extensions are written for Ingevity, but are released for public use as is. 

## Left remaining on SlickGrid

<!-- * change naming from config -->
<!-- * edit functionality -->
<!-- * datetime editor for timestamp -->
* Datetime editor (HTML5's datetime-local input is not very good, so left it as a text editor.)
* editor dependent on tag type (Not required, currently just defaults to Float Editor. Could add editor selection to config.)
* excel copy/paste functionality (This will require different keyboard shortcuts for copy and paste as the others are taken by PI Vision)
<!-- * update colors when config changes -->
<!-- * update headers when config changes -->
<!-- * column width in config -->
<!-- * Datetime column custom sorter algorithm -->
